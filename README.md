## Project 1 : customising  NGINX
This is the foundational project on Docker and the basics of interacting with containers!

1. Run a container based on the **NGINX** image,using the specific tag **1.27.0**.
2. Get an **interactive shell** running inside of the conatiner.
3. install the text editor **vim**.
4. Modify the index.html from the NGINX server to deliver custom content.

                        OR

**we can use dockerfile to automate this process of installing and changing the custom page of the index.html**
